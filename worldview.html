    <div id= "worldview"> <b> Q: How was the universe created? <br> A: </b>The universe was created when God said let there be light and bam there was light. Over the next six days, God spoke everything from the heavens to the earth into existence.  Everything that came to being was created when God spoke it to be. Before God said let there be light, there was nothing, only a dark void that was shapeless and empty. <br><b> Q: What does it mean to be a human being? <br> A: </b>As humans, we are made in God’s image. As a Christian, we are called to live by a moral code that is given to us by God. In addition, we all have a purpose according to God’s plan. <b><br> Q: What happens when you die? <br> A: </b>When we die, our physical body decays, but our spirit will be united with God in heaven, if you believe in God and that Jesus covered all our sins when he died on the cross. If you are not a believer, you get banished to hell.
