  <div id="bio"> My name is Chesna Gamble. I’ve lived in four countries (America, Uganda, India and now Cambodia). Idk I’m not a very interesting person so I don’t know what else to say. I have three siblings of which I’m the second oldest. When I graduate High School, the goal as of now is to attend Trinity Western University or Northwest Nazarene University and major in International business and maybe minor in Psychology or Biblical Studies. My goal in life is to help people, how I am going to go about that I’m not sure yet. Another goal of mine is to have lots of dogs because dogs are pretty cute. My favorite holiday is Christmas and my favorite season is fall.
